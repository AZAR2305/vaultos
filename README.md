# VaultOS - Real-time Prediction Market

**Production Ready - Powered by Yellow Network**

> Instant, gasless prediction market trading using Yellow Network state channels

---

## 🎯 What is VaultOS?

VaultOS is a next-generation prediction market platform that solves two critical problems:
1. **Speed**: Traditional blockchain prediction markets are slow (15+ seconds per trade)
2. **Cost**: Every trade costs gas fees, making micro-trading expensive

### The Solution

VaultOS uses Yellow Network's Nitrolite state channels to enable:
- ⚡ **Instant trades** (< 100ms)
- 💸 **Zero gas fees** during trading
- 🔒 **Session-based security** (protect your main wallet)
- 🎮 **Real-time experience** like Web2, powered by Web3
- 🔐 **Cryptographically secure** off-chain settlement

### Security Model

**Why Yellow Node is NOT Trusted:**

1. **Every state update is signed by user** - Yellow node cannot forge transactions
2. **User maintains cryptographic proof** - Can prove correct state on-chain if needed
3. **Session key limits exposure** - Main wallet private key stays offline
4. **Spending allowance enforced** - Maximum loss is bounded

**Dispute Resolution:**
- If Yellow node misbehaves → User submits signed state to L1 contract
- Smart contract verifies signatures → Correct state is enforced
- User always wins with valid signatures

## � Sui Integration (NEW!)

VaultOS now includes **Sui blockchain integration** for transparent market settlement:

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Trading Layer:** Yellow Network (off-chain, instant)
- **Settlement Layer:** Sui (on-chain, transparent)

### What It Does
When a prediction market resolves, the final outcome is recorded on Sui as an immutable object. This provides:
- ✅ **Transparent verification** - Anyone can verify outcomes
- ✅ **Tamper-proof records** - Settlements are permanent
- ✅ **Hybrid benefits** - Speed + Trust

### Quick Deploy
```powershell
# Deploy Sui settlement contract
npm run sui:deploy

# Test the integration
npm run sui:test-settlement
```

📖 **Full Guide:** [SUI_QUICK_START.md](SUI_QUICK_START.md) (5 commands, 5 minutes)

**Contract:** [sui/sources/prediction_settlement.move](sui/sources/prediction_settlement.move)

## 🎮 Demo Flow (2-3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Create Session
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/session/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"depositAmount": 1000}'
```

Save the `sessionId` from response.

### Step 3: Create Market
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/market/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Will BTC reach $150k by June 2026?",
    "description": "Resolves YES if Bitcoin reaches $150,000 USD",
    "durationMinutes": 30,
    "yesPrice": 0.55
  }'
```

Save the `marketId` from response.

### Step 4: Buy YES Shares
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/trade/buy-yes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "marketId": "YOUR_MARKET_ID",
    "shares": 100
  }'
```

**Result**: Instant trade execution! Check console for real-time logs.

### Step 5: Check State
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/state/YOUR_SESSION_ID
```

See your balances, positions, and signatures.

### Step 6: Move Some to Idle
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/balance/move-to-idle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "amount": 200
  }'
```

### Step 7: Accrue Yield (simulated)
```bash
# Wait a few seconds, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/balance/accrue-yield \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID"}'
```

### Step 8: Close Session
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/session/close \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID"}'
```

## 🔐 Security Deep Dive

### Session Key Model

**Problem**: Using main wallet for every trade exposes private key
**Solution**: Session key with limited permissions

```typescript
// Session key properties:
{
  maxAllowance: 1000 USDC,      // Can't spend more
  duration: 3600 seconds,        // Auto-expires
  maxRefund: 25%,                // Limited emergency exit
  singleUse: true                // Can't be reused
}
```

### State Signing

Every action creates a signed state update:

```typescript
// What gets signed:
channelId + nonce + activeBalance

// Signature properties:
- Proves user authorization
- Cannot be forged
- Incrementing nonce prevents replay
- Can be verified by anyone
```

### Dispute Mechanism (High-Level)

1. **Normal case**: Yellow node processes state updates correctly
2. **Dispute case**: Node submits wrong final state
3. **User defense**: Submit signed state to L1 contract
4. **Resolution**: Contract verifies signatures → User wins

## 📊 How Pricing Works (Phase 1)

### Simple Fixed Odds Model

For MVP simplicity, we use fixed pricing:

```
YES price + NO price = 1.0

Example Market:
- YES: 0.65 (65% implied probability)
- NO: 0.35 (35% implied probability)
```

### Trade Calculation

**Buying:**
```
Cost = Shares × Price
Example: 100 YES shares at 0.65 = 65 USDC
```

**Selling:**
```
Payout = Shares × Current Price
Example: 100 YES shares at 0.65 = 65 USDC back
```

### Phase 2 Improvements

Future versions could add:
- AMM pricing (Uniswap-style bonding curve)
- Order book matching
- Dynamic odds based on volume
- Liquidity pools

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Instant Trading
Traditional prediction markets wait for blockchain confirmation (15-60 seconds).
VaultOS trades execute in < 100ms via state channels.

### 2. Gasless Experience
Users pay zero gas fees during trading session.
Only pay gas once (deposit) and once (settlement).

### 3. Session Security
Main wallet stays offline and safe.
Session key has limited permissions and auto-expires.

### 4. Idle Balance Yield
Unused capital earns yield automatically.
Phase 2 integrates real Sui DeFi protocols.

### 5. Flexible Refunds
Emergency 25% refund available if needed.
Balances liquidity needs with commitment.
